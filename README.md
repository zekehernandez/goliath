# Throwing Stars (Real Name TBD)

The goal is to hit targets with your throwing weapon.
Click and hold to start your jump, how long you hold determines how far you jump.
Release the mouse button to jump.

Once in the air click again to enter a slow motion targeting event. As your targeting arrow spins around, click the mouse to throw blades in the direction the arrow is clicking.
